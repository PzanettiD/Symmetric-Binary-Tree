# Symmetric-Binary-Tree
## Inspiration
This project was greatly inspired by a youtube video, you can check [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jjeOYMjmDU). But needless to say that I added quite a few changes to the original project.
## The application
The concepts behind the mathematics of the project are better explained in [this link](http://ecademy.agnesscott.edu/~lriddle/ifs/pythagorean/symbinarytree.htm), but in just a few words, **the symmetric binary tree is obtained by continuing to add more branches ad infinitum, using the angle θ and scaling factor r for each set of new branch segments.** The angle θ in this case, can be manipulated through the arrow keys, and is displayed on the screen.
## Processing
Processing is a flexible software sketchbook and a language for learning how to code within the context of the visual arts. Since 2001, Processing has promoted software literacy within the visual arts and visual literacy within technology. There are tens of thousands of students, artists, designers, researchers, and hobbyists who use Processing for learning and prototyping.
